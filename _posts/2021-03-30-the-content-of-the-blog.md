__Hello world!__ Welcome to my blog!

First thing first, let me introduce myself. 
My name is Gwendal Jouneaux and, at the time I write this post, I am a first-year Ph.D. Student in computer science at the University of Rennes (France)/Inria/IRISA. 
I graduated a few months ago from the <a href="https://esir.univ-rennes1.fr/en">ESIR</a><d-footnote>The <a href="https://esir.univ-rennes1.fr/en">engineering school</a> departement of the <a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/">university of Rennes</a></d-footnote> and from the research in computer science master at the University of Rennes thanks to a double-diploma.

My Ph.D. is entitled **“Self-Adaptable Languages”** and is supervised by <a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Benoit.Combemale/" target="_blank">Benoit Combemale</a>, <a href="https://olivier.barais.fr/" target="_blank">Olivier Barais</a> and <a href="http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~gmussb1/" target="_blank">Gunter Mussbacher</a>. 
In addition to SLE<d-footnote>Software Language Engineering</d-footnote>, MDE<d-footnote>Model-Driven Engineering</d-footnote>, and Self-Adaptive Systems, which are related to my Ph.D. subject, I’m also deeply interested in cross-cutting aspects of computer science like software performances and energy consumption.

## So... What about this blog ?

This blog is a place for me to talk informally about the subjects that I like (*i.e.* the topics mentionned above). 
There will be mainly three types of posts : Technical, Vulgarization and Thoughts.

### Technical

The first category, **Technical posts**, is a way for me to present tools, techniques or even implementations of everything that I found interesting.

For instance, I often work with tools like language workbenches, parser generators and eco-systems like the one of GraalVM.
Those are complex yet useful tools, and that's why I would like to present them, what you can do, what you can't and how I used them.

On the other hand, posts on techniques and implementations will regroup more conceptual things (*e.g.* algorithms, design patterns) and how they can be used to build funny/interesting/useful/whatever project you could have in mind.

In the end, those posts form the "How to ..." section of this blog.

### Vulgarization

### Thoughts
