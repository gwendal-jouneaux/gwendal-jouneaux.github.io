Despite the sanitary situation and the need to teach remotely, I had the opportunity to give lectures in the SRIO course and manage practical sessions of the courses I was involved in.

- DLC (Devops and continuous delivery) for **Master 2**, *Software Engineering* path
- VV (Software verification and validation) for **Master 1**, *Software Engineering* path
- SRIO (IoT and Network Security) for **Master 1**, *Security, Smart cities and IoT* path

*Note : In the SRIO Course, I was in charge of the Android security section*
