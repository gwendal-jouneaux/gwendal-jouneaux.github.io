<p>During this year I was teaching assistant at the University of Rennes 1, especially in the engineering school (ESIR).</p>

<p>Despite the sanitary situation and the need to teach remotely, I had the opportunity to give lectures in the SRIO course and manage practical sessions of the courses I was involved in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>DLC (Devops and continuous delivery) for <strong>Master 2</strong>, <em>Software Engineering</em> path</li>
  <li>VV (Software verification and validation) for <strong>Master 1</strong>, <em>Software Engineering</em> path</li>
  <li>SRIO (IoT and Network Security) for <strong>Master 1</strong>, <em>Security, Smart cities and IoT</em> path</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note : In the SRIO Course, I was in charge of the Android security section</em></p>
