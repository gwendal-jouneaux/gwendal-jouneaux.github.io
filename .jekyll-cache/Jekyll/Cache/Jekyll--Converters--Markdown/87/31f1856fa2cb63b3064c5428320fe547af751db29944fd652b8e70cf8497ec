<p>We choosed to not use back-end computations to be able to publish the game in a Github Page and let everyone have fun with this project. We used Angular to create this project because we didnâ€™t know how to create an Angular application and we wanted to learn this new technology.</p>

<p>For the Artificial Intelligences, we have started by creating a basic AI which play randomly but always follow the rules of the game. So we begin to create the game flow and the function that calculate the valid moves of a given pawn. After that, create the random AI was really easy, we just have to pick randomly one of the AIâ€™s pawn and play randomly one of its valid moves.</p>

<p>After that we created two other AI that are more â€œCleverâ€ than the random one. This two AI used the same algorithm, a Min-Max algorithm. The main issue is that there is millions of nodes in a Min-Max tree of the entire game. So, we used some heuristics to give an â€œAdvantageâ€ value for the possibles boards and process the Min-Max tree only on a selected depth. The difference between the two level of â€œCleverâ€ AI is only the heuristics we selected for the â€œAdvantageâ€ calculation.</p>
