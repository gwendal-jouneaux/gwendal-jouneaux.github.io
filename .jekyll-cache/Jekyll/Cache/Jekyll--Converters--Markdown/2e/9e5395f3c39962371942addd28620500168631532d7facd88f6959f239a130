<p class="text-justify">
The research master is composed of two parts, the common course and the specialized courses.
Common courses are courses about research in general. There is courses about writing scientific papers, scientific methodology and some conferences about research in France and in the world. 
Moreover, in order to validate our internship, we need to write bibliographic study on our internship subject before it starts. This bibliographic study will be defended during the master's colloquim.
